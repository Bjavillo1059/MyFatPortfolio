                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Brandon javillo and here is a little about me.  I am a recently retired US Army Veteran, proud to have served and love every minute of the traveling and relationships I've built along the way!  Currently I am married to the most beautiful, loving, caring, and amazing woman and I have 4 children.  I spent 20 years in the military as a aircraft electrician and loved my job!  I left the Army earlier than I really wanted to, but moved on to a bigger and better future with coding.  I recently just started in the UC Davis Full Stack bootcamp and when complete, plan to move on to UNLV to complete a BS in Computer Science.  Let's just say because of my love for videogames and my job in the militray, I now have chosen something that I enjoy and look forward to learning anything and everything I can!

                I love doing whatever makes my family and I happy.  Whether it's hiking the outdoors, to taking pictures at National Parks, or even just sitting around playing with our fur babies.  We love everything.  Most of all, my family are my food buddies; because I love to eat everything I drag my family around with me just try any dish atleast once!
